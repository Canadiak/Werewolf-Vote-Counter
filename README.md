# Werewolf-Vote-Counter
Vote Counter for Werewolf. Currently going through bug testing. I believe it's bug free at the moment.

How to use: Enter the person voting in the 'enter voter' box and the proposal you're voting for in the 'enter proposal' box. Comment # is optional. Then press submit vote. Reloading the page will make the votes appear, and then you can copy paste into the forum. 

Delete a vote by putting the name of the voter and proposal in the delete box. Reset vote count deletes all entered votes.

The code at the bottom can be shared with other people so they don't need to retype everything.
